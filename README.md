# My Favorite Series: Chainsaw Man

Chainsaw Man is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by **Tatsuki Fujimoto**.  
It follows *Denji*, a young man who lives in poverty with his pet devil, *Pochita*.  
After a tragic event, Pochita merges with Denji, giving him the power to transform parts of his body into chainsaws —  
thus becoming the devil-human hybrid known as **Chainsaw Man**.
